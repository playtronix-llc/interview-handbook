      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>
        At Playtronix, we evaluate candidates on broad distributed engineering skills
        and strong software engineering fundamentals; this guide applies to both frontend
        and backend interviews. Our interview framework focuses on problem-solving and
        learning agility, letting us see both depth and breadth. We want to understand not
        only how you code, but how you think. The process is structured in 3 stages, with
        interviews scheduled accordingly.
      </p>

      <h3>Stage 1 · Live coding round · 60 minutes · Online</h3>
      <p>
        In this interview, you will solve coding problems live using LeetCode’s online coding
        platform. You will share your screen with the interviewer throughout the session—no IDE
        setup is required.
      </p>
      <p>
        This round will primarily focus on data structures and algorithms, so be prepared to
        solve problems involving arrays, strings, recursion, linked lists, trees, graphs,
        dynamic programming, and other core concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please ensure you have an active LeetCode account before the interview, as all coding
        will be done directly on LeetCode during the session.
      </p>
      <p>Each interview is capped at 60 minutes and is designed to evaluate:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Problem-solving skills</li>
        <li>Code quality and efficiency</li>
        <li>Understanding of algorithms and data structures</li>
        <li>Communication of thought process</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Stage 2 · Tech round · 60 minutes · On-site interview</h3>
      <p>
        Note: This round is required to be conducted offline at our Belgrade office. Under
        exceptional circumstances, it may be run online via Google Meet and
        <a href="https://excalidraw.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">excalidraw.com</a>
        for drawing system architecture.
      </p>
      <p>
        This interview assesses your technical depth, breadth, and problem-solving through
        designing a solution to a defined problem. Your interviewer will evaluate your thought
        process, decision-making, and considerations such as performance and reliability. It
        varies between frontend and backend as follows:
      </p>

      <h4>Backend</h4>
      <p>
        It is a typical system design round. You will design a solution on a whiteboard or paper,
        starting with fundamentals and adding complexity. Asking clarifying questions early and
        clearly communicating your thinking is essential. We are interested in your approach, how
        you draw from past experience, and how you design with customers, scalability, and
        reliability in mind. You can also expect questions in the language of your specialty and
        some questions based on your previous experience.
      </p>

      <h4>Frontend</h4>
      <p>
        The session will include a live-coding segment. Tasks will be short and focused on
        practical skills—e.g., code small utilities in JS/TS, solve a React component logic
        challenge, build a tiny state machine, or optimize a performance bottleneck. We evaluate
        code clarity, ability to reason about edge cases, and how well you translate theoretical
        knowledge into practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please be prepared for in-depth theory questions across JS/TS, React and its ecosystem,
        system design and architecture, and frontend performance. We will focus on language
        fundamentals and React internals. Expect scenario-based reasoning rather than rote
        definitions.
      </p>

      <h3>Stage 3 · Behavioural round · 60 minutes · Online</h3>
      <p>
        This interview includes a set of behavioural interview questions, aimed at assessing how
        your thought process and actions are aligned with our core set of company values. In this
        round, we are keen to understand how you collaborate with your teams, cross-functional
        communication, previous projects, and to get a deeper sense of your ambitions to ensure
        the role is in fact the right one for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our questions will be scenario-based, so please come prepared with examples that
        demonstrate your experience across one or more projects that you have been a part of or
        have led.
